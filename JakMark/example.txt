You can preserve line breaks with  
two spaces at the end of the paragraph. This -- is an emdash. These \!--\! are two dashes.

You can talk about \!*<list> s*\! without having them rendered by escaping them with `\!...\!`.

\!*_-+><___][]|\!

This is fenced.		And you can do whatever you like.

<table>
head1		| head2
cell1.1		| cell1.2
cell2.1		| cell2.2

<table>
shead1 | shead2 | shead3
lala | baba | cucu
lala | baba | cucu
lala | baba | cucu
</table> | cell 1.2
cell2.1		| cell2.2

Lists:

<list>
- bullet1
  <list>

  - sub bullet2
  </list>

  multiple lines using  
  two spaces at the end of the previous line.
